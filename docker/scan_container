#This script is called as part of a Travis build.  After a container image is build
#via 'docker build' we use this to scan the image for vulnerabilities using a local
#version of Clair.  The scan is run before the image is pushed to the Docker repository.
#
#The name of the local image is passed via the environment variable IMAGE_TO_SCAN
#
#FAILURE_VULNERABILITY_LEVEL (set below) determines which CVE severity level we'll
#fail a build on if anything in the container meets that level.
#
#Additionally we pass Clair a whitelist of CVE IDs that, if detected, won't fail the
#build.  The purpose of that is that there are likely to be vulnerabilities that can't
#be fixed due to no updated package being available and which we might not consider
#to critical.
#The whitelist is generated by render_whitelist() below.

## Trying to get the latest version of clair_scanner didn't work because we kept hitting API rate limits
## (everyone on Travis is probably trying the same thing).  So we've got a hard-coded version for the moment.
## However, authenticated requests have a higher rate, so in the future we could use an authentication
## token to get the info.  The script below will download the latest version:
##
## curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/arminc/clair-scanner/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*clair-scanner_linux_amd64" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -O /tmp/clair_scanner -qi -

wget -O /tmp/clair_scanner -q https://github.com/arminc/clair-scanner/releases/download/${CLAIR_SCANNER_VERSION}/clair-scanner_linux_amd64
